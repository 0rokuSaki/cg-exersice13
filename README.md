# CG-Maman13
My solution for Q4 in exersice ('Maman') 13 in Computer Graphics (20562) course. </br>
This program demonstrates the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm by showing a step-by-step animation. </br>
It is based on the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm implementation in the book 'Computer Graphics with OpenGL, 4th edition' by Donald Hearn and Pauline Baker.
